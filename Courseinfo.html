<p>This dynamic computing course has an excellent reputation within the IT industry and will give you the practical experience and technical knowledge you need to excel in the computing sector. 
You’ll cover a range of subjects relating to modern computing, including internet technologies, usability and systems software. 
93% of our final year students said they were able to access general IT resources, specialised equipment, facilities, or rooms when they needed to. Why not come along and visit us to see these for yourself? </p>
<p>What’s more, all our courses are accredited by the British Computing Society (BCS). 
To be awarded Chartered IT Professional status from BCS you will need to complete a year of further learning beyond graduation and meet other criteria, details of which can be found on the BCS website.</p>
<p>We understand that computing is a diverse subject and that it can be difficult to know what area you’d like to specialise in at this stage in your career. 
That’s why all of our courses within the computing framework share a common first year, giving you the time to really explore the subject before deciding on a specialism. 
There are courses that allow you to keep a relatively wide focus, as well as degrees that provide a greater level of specialism, giving you plenty of flexibility when it comes to which direction you want your career to take.</p>
